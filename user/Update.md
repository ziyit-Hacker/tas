#### Version Description:  
Version 3.0.0 "Beta" represents a comprehensive upgrade focusing on **functional enrichment, user experience refinement, security reinforcement, and system standardization**. Building on core feature expansions, this beta release enhances stability and compliance while introducing practical management tools.  

In terms of user experience optimization: The adjusted "return" navigation aligns with natural browsing habits, reducing operational friction. The newly launched Music page caters to diverse audio needs, offering free streaming/downloads alongside exclusive VIP content. Additionally, the optional Cookie disablement feature empowers users with greater control over their privacy, complying with data protection best practices.  

For Backrooms enthusiasts, the WIKI section receives substantial content updates: The new "Sub-Areas Collection" and "Items" lists streamline content organization, making it easier to explore lore. Complemented by two creative new levels (Level !+ and Level NO DATA) and the whimsical "Laugh Repellent" item, the Backrooms universe is further expanded with immersive and engaging content.  

Security and system robustness are key pillars of this update: Enhanced permission verification safeguards sensitive functions (e.g., Admin Dashboard) against unauthorized access. The revised user data logic—while potentially triggering forced logouts—lays the groundwork for more reliable data management. Meanwhile, the introduction of a credit blacklist and optimized ban system strengthens platform governance, fostering a safe and orderly user environment.  

The VIP membership system adds a tiered service model, allowing users to unlock premium benefits while supporting the platform’s sustainable development. As a beta release, it integrates practicality, entertainment, and security, delivering a more comprehensive experience—with minor adjustments (e.g., forced logouts) expected to be refined based on user feedback for a polished official launch.
